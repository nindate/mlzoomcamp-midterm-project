## About the Project

Banks are important institutions that provide funds, in terms of loans, to businesses and individuals to function and prosper. However banks need money to provide as loan and to also make their own investments (e.g. in stocks). One such good source that banks have is in the from of Term Deposits that bank's customers make.

Banks regularly make calls to their customers to secure such Term deposits. However, from a big list of all its customers, it would be wise to make calls to the customers who are more likely to invest. This way, banks can reduce the cost of acquisition of Term deposit (in the form of payment to staff making call, call charges and so on.).

This project aims at building a machine learning model that can be trained from previous marketing campaigns and data collected, to predict customers that potentialy will subscribe to Term deposit with the bank. Further, the prediction model will be hosted as a web service, which can accept customer data (in JSON format) and return the prediction (whether customer is likely to subscribe to Term deposit).
